My Emacs configuration. It's here so that I can synchronize it across
computers I work with.

I have copied or adapted the contents of some of the files from other
people. For small chunks of code, I have embedded the source URL in a
comment inside the file. When copying has been extensive, I have
retained the original copyright in the file.
